# Email Validator Demonstration 

This project demonstrates how to validate an email address using Angular2 backed by APIs built with Express.

Please ensure Node.js is installed. For instructions on project set up, refer to the readme files in "api\_server" and "email\_validator". 

By default, the backend server will listen on port 8000 on localhost.
If this port is not available, please change the port number in "api\_server/app.js", and also update api address in "email\_validator/src/app/config.ts".
